<p class="centerforestgreen" >Or to be more specific an Apple Pie that's more on the tart side of things. Particularly with apples such as the well known Granny Smith variety(A sliced one of which is pictured above). I like when the crust is properly buttered and the apples inside are spiced especially. The main reason for the tart preference is that the sweeter apple pies tend to be too overpoweringly sweet for my tastes and can leave the whole thing tasting like a lump of sugar encased in crust. I also like when the apples are not cooked down to the point of being more of an apple sauce or just being very mushy as I like to have a little crunch to the apple as I eat it.</p>

<p class="leftcrimson">As for why i'd view it as a favorite compared to other options here is a small list of some other desserts off the top of my head and why they aren't as favorable to my tastes.</p>
<dl>
    <dt class="list1">Cake</dt>
    <dd class="list1">- I like the texture of the crust and the apples and the sauce more than that of cake overall. Not to say I dislike cake though.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt class="list2">Ice Cream</dt>
    <dd class="list2">- While Ice Cream is more of a flavor by flavor basis this is more due to me liking a warmer dessert like pie more. Especially in the winter season.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt class="list3">Other Pie Varieties</dt>
    <dd class="list3">In terms of the pies so far that i've had I just prefer this one more due to things like the taste of the spiced tart apples and the texture of the crunch when all is done right.</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<aside>Note:It is not that I dislike these I just like the apple pie more.</aside>
